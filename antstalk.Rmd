## Community response

- Just wanted to let you know---ANTS worked for me!  I seem to be getting interesting results along the line_ s of what I was predicting my study would find in specific parts of the striatum.  _--Patryk from Ireland_

- To put not to fine a point on it---ANTS rocks.  _--Craig from California_

- The ANTS package is very, very cool!  _--Jaime from Wisconsin_

- Thank you for sharing this work, and congratulations for a job well done.  _--Alexandra from North Carolina_

## SyN formulation
$$
\begin{aligned}
  \inf_{\phi_1} \inf_{\phi_2}   \Bigg[
                     \int_0^{0.5} & \left( \|v_1(t)\|_L^2 + \|v_2(t)\|_L^2 \right) dt \nonumber \\
                     &+
                     \int_{\Omega} \Pi_{\sim}
                          \left( I \circ \phi_1^{-1}(\mathbf{x},0.5),
                           J \circ \phi_2^{-1}(\mathbf{x},0.5) \right) d\Omega \Bigg]
\end{aligned}
$$
where
$$
\begin{align}
  \frac{d \phi_i(\mathbf{x},t)}{dt} = v_i( \phi_i(\mathbf{x},t), t ),\,\, \phi_i(\mathbf{x},0) = \mathbf{Id}, \,\, i \in \{1,2\}
\end{align}
$$
and $\Pi_{\sim}$ is an arbitrary similarity metric (or metrics).

## SyN for optimization symmetry
![](./figures/fishSyN.png)
Images deform symmetrically along the shape manifold.  This eliminates bias in the
measurement of image differences.

## Minimizing interpolations
![](./figures/oneInterpolation.png)

$\mathcal{T}_{total} = \mathcal{T}_1 \circ \mathcal{T}_2 \circ \mathcal{T}_3 \circ \mathcal{T}_4$

To avoid compounding interpolation error with the concatenation of transformations, ANTs never
uses more than a single interpolation.

# The stories behind ANTs development

(we can comment this out but I think it would be good to make some notes for posterity)

## Registration

## N4

* N3 (developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute) has been the gold standard for
bias correction---used in important projects such as ADNI

* N3 is a set of perl scripts that works natively with the MINC file format which we tried
to incorporate into an ANTs processing pipeline.

* We had so much trouble converting back and forth between ITK-compatible Nifti format and
MINC that Brian suggested we try to implement N3 in ITK.

* I had some experience with B-splines and added some other tweaks giving birth to N4.

## N4 Introduction

![](./figures/n4_introduction.png)

## Nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3)

Sled et al., “A nonparametric method for automatic correction of intensity nonuniformity in MRI Data,” _IEEE-TMI_, 17(1), 1998.

***

Boyes et al., “Intensity non-uniformity correction using N3 on 3-T scanners with multichannel phased array coils,” _NeuroImage_, 39(4), 2008.

> In a comparison of several correction techniques N3 performed well (Arnold et al., 2001).
> Also, the algorithm and software are in the public domain
> (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/software/N3/) and is probably the most widely used non-uniformity
> correction technique in neurological imaging.

Zheng et al., “Improvement of brain segmentation accuracy by optimizing non-uniformity correction using N3,” _NeuroImage_, 48(1), 2009.

> Among existing approaches, the nonparametric non-uniformity intensity normalization method N3
> (Sled et al., 1998) is one of the most frequently used... High performance and robustness have
> practically turned N3 into an industry standard.

Vovk et al., “A Review of Methods for Correction of Intensity Inhomogeneity in MRI,” _IEEE-TMI_, 26(3), 2007.

> A well-known intensity inhomogeneity correction method, known as the N3 (nonparametric
> nonuniformity normalization), was proposed in [15]...  Interestingly, no improvements have
> been suggested for this highly popular and successful method...  The nonparametric
> nonuniformity normalization (N3) method [15] has obviously become the standard method
> against which other methods are compared.

## Atropos

* Similar to our experience with N3, we tried to incorporate FAST (from the FMRIB at Oxford)
into an ANTs processing pipeline.

* Phil (?) pointed out the difficulty of incorporating priors into FAST.

* Related, Brian went to a segmentation-related worksop at MICCAI and aired publicly his
disappointment that so much of what had been developed in the community over the last
20+ years has not been made publicly available.  "What's wrong with you people!"

* 3-tissue algorithm in ImageMath ---> multivariate, n-class Atropos

# Putting it all together

## The ANTs cortical thickness pipeline

![](./figures/pipeline.png)

[*Large-scale evaluation of ANTs and FreeSurfer cortical thickness measurements*, NeuroImage 2014.*](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24879923)

All software components are open source and part of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) repository.

## Basic components of the pipeline

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/components.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

1. template building (offline)
2. brain extraction
3. cortical thickness estimation
4. cortical parcellation

## Template building

*Tailor data to your specific cohort*

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/templates.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

* Templates representing the average mean shape and intensity are built directly from the cohort to be analyzed, e.g. pediatric vs. middle-aged brains.
* Acquisition and anonymization (e.g. defacing) protocols are often different.

## Template building (cont.)

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/templatePriors.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

Each template is [processed](https://github.com/ntustison/antsCookTemplatePriorsExample)
to produce auxiliary images which are used for brain extraction and brain segmentation.

## Brain extraction

<div align="center"><img height="380" src="./figures/brainExtraction.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

Comparison with de facto standard FreeSurfer package.  Note the difference in separation of
the gray matter from the surrounding CSF.  (0 failures out of 1205 scans)

## Brain segmentation

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/brainSegmentation.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

Randomly selected healthy individuals.  Atropos gets good performance across ages.

## Cortical thickness estimation

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/corticalThicknessEstimation.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

In contrast to FreeSurfer which warps coupled surface meshes to segment the gray matter, ANTs diffeomorphically registers the white matter to the combined gray/white matters while simultaneously estimating thickness.

## Data inspection w/*ANTsR*

spider plots ....

## Evaluation

_Question_:  In the absence of ground truth, how do we evaluate performance?

_Answer_:  We use demographic information with known thickness sensitivity and correlate
with measured thickness quantities.  One of the most well-known, most easily obtained,
and most confident measures available is “age.”  So we take 50% of the thickness data to
train a model (e.g. linear regression) and then calculate the model’s age prediction error
on the other 50%.  We do this for n=1000 permutations to build a distribution.   Similarly,
we can do this for gender.

<div align="center"><img height="350" src="./figures/evaluation.png" frameborder="0"></img></div>

## A couple notes on usage

* Out of the many cortical thickness algorithms that have been proposed, FreeSurfer dominates.  And rightfully so, because it works well and has been the only publicly available tool (until reccently).
* In the same spirit, we have made our tools publicly available.  Usage is similar to that of FreeSurfer (see below).  We also make several templates available.

# Instrumentation bias in the use and evaluation of software

# Discussion

There are several problems and shortcomings to this analysis.

- Customizable for specific problems but not too specific
- Latest theoretical advances in registration not yet wrapped for users

## Strengths

Some strengths include relatively few assumptions, a flexible
implementation and open-science approach.
