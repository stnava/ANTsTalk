# Bias Correction a.k.a. Inhomogeneity Correction

## N4

* N3 (developed at the Montreal Neurological Institute) has been the gold standard for
bias correction---used in important projects such as ADNI

* N3 is a set of perl scripts that works natively with the MINC file format which we tried
to incorporate into an *ANTs* processing pipeline.

* We had so much trouble converting back and forth between ITK-compatible Nifti format and
MINC that BA suggested we try to implement N3 in ITK.

* NT had some experience with B-splines and added some other tweaks giving birth to N4.
