## Definitions

* Registration $=$ geometric mapping between image pairs or image sets (e.g. Affine)

* Diffeomorphisms $=$ differentiable map with differentiable inverse (e.g. "silly putty", viscous fluid)  

* Segmentation $=$ labeling tissue or anatomy in images, usually automated (e.g. K-means)

* Multivariate $=$ using many voxels or measurements at once (e.g. PCA, $p >> n$ ridge regression)

* Multiple modality $=$ using many modalities at once (e.g. DTI and T1 and BOLD)

* Dimensionality reduction $=$ principled way of finding few variables to represent many variables (e.g. PCA, CCA)

<!--
#  *ANTs* is an image processing platform for reproducible <span style="color:red;">multiple modality</span> image analysis & <span style="color:red;">multivariate statistics</span>
##  <span style="color:red;">ANTs*R*</span> Platform for Medical Imaging
![](figures/antsgoals.png)
this document [is another goal of ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsTalk/) as is [this one](http://stnava.github.io/RKRNS/)
-->

# *ANTs* optimizes mathematically well-defined <span style="color:red;">objective functions</span> guided by <span style="color:red;">prior knowledge</span>  ...

# ... including that of developers, domain experts and users ...

# our strong <span style="color:red;">mathematical and software engineering</span> foundation leads to near limitless opportunities for innovation in a variety of application domains

# plug *your ideas* into our software to gain insight into biomedical data ...

 
# Registration with priors 

## prior knowledge about how to map - e.g. lesion brains

## we need to rotate

## we need to scale and shear 

## we need to deform ( but not the lesion )

## Fine-grained and flexible maps

# Segmentation with priors 

## tissue 

## anatomy 

## cortical thickness

# ANTs in competition

## "grand challenges"

## ANTs versus Freesurfer 

# ANTs statistics: *ANTsR* 

## ANTsR code example 

## BRATS competition

## EANAT 

## SCCAN 

# ANTs Innovations

## coordinated multivariate statistical fields arise from this mapping
