# Wrap-up & Discussion 

## Many instructional examples for new colleagues

[see examples @ *ANTs* webpage](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)

## Recap

- Powerful, general-purpose, <span style="color:red;">well-evaluated</span> registration and segmentation.

- Differentiable maps with differentiable inverse <span style="color:red;">$+$ statistics in these spaces</span>

- Evaluated in multiple problem domains</span> via internal studies & open competition

- Borg philosophy: <span style="color:red;">"best of"</span> from I/O, to processing to statistical methods

- Open source, testing, many examples, consistent style, multiple platforms,  active community support ...

- Integration with *R* $+$ novel tools for prediction, decoding, high-to-low dimensional statistics.

- Collaborations with [neurodebian](http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/ants.html), [slicer](http://www.slicer.org/), [brainsfit](https://github.com/BRAINSia/BRAINSTools), [nipype](http://nipy.sourceforge.net/nipype/), [itk](http://www.itk.org) and more ...


## Challenges: Computational and Scientific

- Scalability
    - **need to fuse feature selection methods with transformation optimization**
    - **need to leverage existing ITK streaming infrastructure in application level tool**
- Domain expertise: Customizable for specific problems but sometimes not specific enough
- "Plausible physical modeling ..." - this should vary per problem ... but doesn't.
    - a fabulous project would be to resolve this issue at a large-scale e.g. for reconstructing neurons, measuring white matter elaboration ...
    - our prior FEM work is one potential solution
- Rapid development: colleagues still need familiarity with compilation for latest ANTs features
- Latest theoretical advances in registration not yet wrapped for users
- Need more [Documentation](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/)  & [testing](http://testing.psychiatry.uiowa.edu/CDash/index.php?project=ANTS) ...


## Tools you can use for imaging science

- Core developers:  *B. Avants, N. Tustison, H. J. Johnson, J. T. Duda*

- Many contributors, including users ...

- Multi-platform, multi-threaded C++ [stnava.github.io/ANTs](stnava.github.io/ANTs)

- Developed in conjunction with [http://www.itk.org/](http://www.itk.org/)

- R wrapping and extension [stnava.github.io/ANTsR](stnava.github.io/ANTsR)

- rapid development, regular testing $+$ many eyes $\rightarrow$ bugs are shallow
