##  Segmentation Framework 

1. Bias correction (with optional priors)

2. Prior-based tissue segmentation

3. Prior-based anatomical labeling 

4. Iteration through above steps (optional)

## We tried N3 and FSL-FAST for these problems ... and *dislike* Matlab ...

failed to locate well-implemented open-source resources for general purpose prior-based 
segmentation and inhomogeneity correction ...

##  Atropos: Bayesian $N$-class multivariate segmentation 

* Similar to our experience with N3, we tried to incorporate FAST (from the FMRIB at Oxford)
into an *ANTs* processing pipeline.

* We failed to successfully incorporate priors into FAST.

* Related, BA went to a segmentation-related worksop at MICCAI and
aired disappointment that so much of what had been developed in the
community over the last 20+ years has not been made publicly
available.  "What's wrong with you people!"

* 3-tissue algorithm in ImageMath $\rightarrow$ multivariate, n-class Atropos
